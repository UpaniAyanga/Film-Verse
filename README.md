🎬 Filmverse - Web Development Coursework 🎥

Welcome to Filmverse, a website about all things films! This project was developed as part of my first-year web development coursework. Everything was built using pure HTML and CSS to demonstrate fundamental web development skills.

✨ Project Overview
This website includes the following sections:

🌐 Header and Footer: Designed consistent headers and footers for easy navigation.
🏠 Homepage: A dynamic landing page introducing visitors to Filmverse.
📝 Blog Post: A single blog post discussing an interesting film topic.
💬 Feedback Form: A form to capture user feedback and opinions on the site or films.
🚧 Incomplete Features
Certain navigation elements and pages are not fully developed as my responsibility was to focus on specific parts of the website, such as the header, footer, homepage, one blog post, and the feedback form.

🎬 How to View
To explore the site, simply open the MainPage.html file in your web browser. From there, you can check out the homepage, blog post, and feedback form.
