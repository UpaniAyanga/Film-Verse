            One of the earliest examples of an action movie is the 1903 film "The Great Train Robbery," directed by Edwin S. Porter.
            Action movies can be further categorized into subgenres, such as martial arts films, spy movies, superhero films, disaster films, and war movies.
            Each subgenre brings its own unique elements and storytelling conventions to the action genre.

            The action movie genre continues to thrive, attracting both established and emerging filmmakers who bring their own creative visions to the genre.
            With its universal appeal and ability to entertain, action movies are likely to remain a staple of the film industry for years to come.
